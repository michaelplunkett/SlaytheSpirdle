# To do
Short term:
- Verify information in CardData (Ascenders Bane should have special rarity )
- identify cards which 
  - apply weak, frail, or vulnerable as debuffs
  - give intangibility as a buff

Long term:
- identify cards which
  - give strength or dex as a buff
  - subtract strength or dex as a debuff
- Make additional entry for every single upgraded card
